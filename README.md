# System-Preferences-Badge-Killer
An extremely short shell script that temporarily removes the badge from the macOS System Preferences application in the dock that tells the user to update to a newer version of macOS

# Notes
- If you cannot run this shell script or when you type "./", the first two letters or so of the name of the shell script, and pressing tab doesn't work, run:
```chmod +x DisableSystemPreferencesBadge.sh```

- If you don't want to cd into the directory that the shell script is, click your desktop, press ```command + shift + G```, then type ```/usr/local```, and hit enter. This will bring you to either a blank or populated directory. If you have a bin folder, drag and drop the shell script there. If it's not there, right click, make a new folder, type in your password if needed, then drag and drop the shell script there. You should now be able to run the script from any directory on your mac!
