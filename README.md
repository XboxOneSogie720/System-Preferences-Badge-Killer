# System-Preferences-Badge-Killer
An extremely short shell script that temporarily removes the badge from the macOS System Preferences application in the dock that tells the user to update to a newer version of macOS

# Notes
- If you cannot run this shell script or when you type "./", the first two letters or so of the name of the shell script, and pressing tab doesn't work, run:
```chmod +x DisableSystemPreferencesBadge.sh```
